# Where to find Documentation

---

This is a templated file found in our central [configuration project](https://github.com/NextThought/nti.util.project.scripts/). All edits to this file are in danger of being overwritten when the template is updated. For product wide documentation, see the [web dev wiki](https://github.com/NextThought/nti.util.project.scripts/wiki) for information on getting setup and the workflow. For package local documentation please use doc-block style code comments or markdown files co-located with the thing you want to document.

I highly recommend installing the [WikiLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lostintangent.wikilens) VSCode extention. With it you can index all the markdown within the workspace, and link/jump and reference document anywhere in the system. (This document and all other readme.md files will be redundant, so add readme.md to WikiLen's ignore list)
